# Pipeline Project

This project is an idea of creating a simple way of creating complicated processes. Not only for developer but for any type of person that wants to do something cool integrating other technologies. Each "node" in the graph will excecute something, that something could be anything your mind can think of.

Heres a preview on how it looks (nodes not available yet):
